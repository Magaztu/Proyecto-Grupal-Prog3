MODELS:
Will only contain db access and data-related logic.

CONTROLLERS:
Will receive petitions from the user (pages) and will redirect them to the MODELS or VIEWS.

VIEWS:
Will return a html variable that stores tags.
-- Supposedly, cuz Pages and Views are actually swapped nhehehjehewj

PAGES:
Is just the html / php that'll interact with the user.


This project's done, so what's the roadmap now?
-> Work to fix existing bugs and make this lil guy the best it can be.
That includes fixing the soup of files I made during the last phases of development lol.
